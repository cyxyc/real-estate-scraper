Project Summary:

In this project, we aim to create a web scraper using Python to extract data from a website, store this data in a local PostgreSQL database, save images related to the data in Google Cloud Storage, and create a Power BI report for data visualization and analysis.

What We Are Doing:

We are setting up a Python-based web scraper to extract data from a website. The scraped data will be stored in a PostgreSQL database for easy access and management. Any images related to the data will be stored in Google Cloud Storage for durability and accessibility. Finally, we'll use Power BI to create interactive visualizations and reports based on the stored data.

Tools We Use:
Web Scraping: Python (BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, or similar library)
Database: PostgreSQL
Database Administration Tool: pgAdmin
Cloud Storage: imgur
Data Visualization: Power BI
Python Library for PostgreSQL: psycopg2

Step-by-Step To-Do List:
Identify the website to be scraped and analyze its structure.
Set up a Python script to scrape the data from the website.
Download and install PostgreSQL and pgAdmin from their official websites.
Set up the PostgreSQL server and connect pgAdmin to the PostgreSQL Server.
Create a new database in pgAdmin.
Modify the Python script to store the scraped data in the PostgreSQL database using the psycopg2 library.
Set up Google Cloud Storage and modify the Python script to store the scraped images in the cloud.
Run the Python script to start the web scraping process.
Use pgAdmin to view and manage the data in the PostgreSQL database.
Import the data from the PostgreSQL database into Power BI.
Create a Power BI report to visualize and analyze the data.
Implement a backup strategy for the PostgreSQL database to avoid data loss.
